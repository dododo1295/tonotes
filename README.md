# toNotes (WIP)
## Safe, Secure Todo and Notes Webapp
###**Severely Alpha**

The goal of this project is to create a todo and note app webapp. This project has no timeline but will be what I work on for the forseeable future outside projects to learn how to make this project.

This projects stack will be

- React front-end in TypeScript (will learn this as we go...)
- Tailwind for CSS
- Go based Server API*
- MongoDB database

*currently debating the use of python for the back-end as the database will be written in python anyway.

##Todo -
### Up next

[] do a bit of python exploration

[] finish scaffolding project

### General Todos
[] create HTML template for front-end

[] figure out the typescript

[] structure the components.

[] sort out all functionality

[] figure out UX.

[] how to encrypt database?
  - encrypt before put in and decrypt on the way out, maybe?

[] figure out how to add and remove from my database via the server or react...

[] create the server.

[] finalize name



[x] create MongoDB database.
