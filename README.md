# toNotes (WIP)
## Safe, Secure Todo and Notes Webapp
###**Severely Alpha**

The goal of this project is to create a todo and note app webapp. This project has no timeline but will be what I work on for the forseeable future outside projects to learn how to make this project.

This projects stack will be

- React front-end in TypeScript (will learn this as we go...)
- Tailwind for CSS
- Go based Server API*
- MongoDB database

*currently debating the use of python for the back-end as the database will be written in python anyway.

###Todo -
[] create HTML template for front-end.
[] figure out the typescript
[] structure the components.
[] figure out UX.
[] create MongoDB database.
[] create the server.
[] finalize name
